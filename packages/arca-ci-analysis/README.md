# arca-ci-analysis

The nightly CI analysis of a GitHub repository, and the step that turns its top finding into one small pull request.
Node 22 or later, no dependencies.

## What it reads

Read-only, from the GitHub Actions API, for a window (7 days by default): every completed workflow run, every job of
every attempt with its steps and timings, the workflow files at the default branch, the repository's cache usage, and
the logs of a bounded sample of jobs (the failed attempts of flaky jobs, the newest other failures, the newest
successful runs of the costliest jobs). A log is parsed as it is read and only what was parsed is kept: cache restores
(hit, partial, miss, gzip or zstd) and tests (failed ones, and those over 2 s with their times; bun, node, cargo,
nextest, go, pytest, jest/vitest/playwright marks, TAP).

Access, from the environment, never printed:

| Variable | What |
|---|---|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | A token that can read the repositories. |
| `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_KEY_B64` | A GitHub App installed on the selected repositories, its PEM key as base64 on one line. The App needs repository permissions **Actions: read**, **Contents: read** and **Metadata: read**, and nothing else. Each run mints an installation token narrowed to one repository and those three permissions. |

## What it reports

Per repository: runs, jobs, runner minutes (rounded up per job, as billed) and cost at list price and as billed (free
minutes of public repositories taken off; self-hosted minutes priced at 0; prices in `src/cost.js`, dated); p50/p95/max
per workflow, job and step; queue time per job and runner; flaky jobs (failed, then passed on the same commit) with the
tests that failed; the slowest tests and whether any log read showed them failing; cache hit rate; and the findings,
ranked by what they save a week (a billed dollar 100 points, a waiting minute 1, an unbilled runner minute 0.2;
estimates weigh 0.6).

| Finding | Change it proposes | PR step writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `paid-runner` | short jobs of a public repository moved off a billed runner to `ubuntu-latest` | yes |
| `cancel-superseded` | a concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress` | yes, when the workflow has none |
| `duplicate-trigger` | `push` limited to named branches when a branch's push and pull request run the same commit | yes |
| `missing-timeout` | `timeout-minutes` of 3 × p95 (at least 10) | yes |
| `add-rust-cache`, `add-setup-cache` | `Swatinem/rust-cache` (pinned to its newest release's commit) or a setup action's `cache` input | yes, except in release jobs |
| `failing-workflow`, `flaky-job`, `slow-test`, `cache-miss`, `cache-gzip`, `cache-full`, `matrix-agree`, `split-job`, `queue` | in words, with the evidence | no: a person or an agent |

## Use

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=... node src/cli.js --repo acme/app --repo acme/lib --out out/
node src/cli.js --dataset out/acme__app/dataset.json --out out/      # analyse a saved dataset again, offline
node src/cli.js --repo acme/app --move-to acme-4vcpu-ubuntu-2404 --out out/  # short billed jobs go to your own pool
node src/pr-cli.js --report out/acme__app/report.json --workdir work/  # draft the top writable finding
node src/pr-cli.js --report out/acme__app/report.json --workdir work/ --open   # push to a fork, open a DRAFT PR
```

`pr-cli.js` without `--open` changes nothing outside `work/`: it clones the repository, commits one change on the branch
`arca-ci/<finding id>`, and writes the patch and the pull request's text next to it. With `--open` it forks the
repository under the signed-in account, pushes the branch there and opens a draft pull request. It never pushes to the
repository itself and never merges.

`pr-cli.js` assumes a public repository: it clones over anonymous https. For a private one, let git use your GitHub
sign-in first (`gh auth setup-git`), and know that `--open` works only where the organisation allows forks of its
private repositories.

`--move-to` (or `MOVE_TO`) takes one runner label of your own pool: a letter, then letters, digits, `.`, `_` and `-`.
A GitHub-hosted or Blacksmith label is refused. Jobs that already carry it are counted as your own pool, at no charge.

A public repository is a risk for your pool. Its jobs reach the pool only if the pool's runner group admits the
repository, and Arca's pool warns when it does: a job on the pool can reach the pool's GitHub credential and the other
slots (see "Who can reach what" in `docs/OPERATING.md`). Anyone can open a pull request from a fork, and a fork pull
request runs its own copy of the workflow, so it can name your pool itself. Where pull requests start a workflow, the
change writes
`runs-on: ${{ github.event.pull_request && github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name != github.repository && 'ubuntu-latest' || '<label>' }}`.
That sends ordinary pull requests from forks to GitHub's free runner, but it is not a wall. If you still want your pool
for a public repository, set fork pull request workflows to need approval for all outside collaborators, and read every
workflow change before you approve a run. The evidence and the pull request text say all this for every move in a
public repository.

## As an Arca function

Without `--out` the CLI prints each repository's Markdown report, shortened to fit the 64 KiB of output Arca keeps,
then one JSON result line (`ok`, and per repository its totals and top three finding ids). The image is built by
`.github/workflows/ci-analysis-image.yml` from `Dockerfile`; its job summary names the digest. The owner approves:

```
action_propose { "action": "function_create", "args": {
  "name": "ci-analysis",
  "image": "ghcr.io/automagik-si/arca-ci-analysis",
  "digest": "sha256:<from the image workflow>",
  "command": ["/usr/local/bin/node", "/app/src/cli.js"],
  "env": { "REPOS": "acme/app,acme/lib", "DAYS": "7", "GITHUB_APP_ID": "<app id>" },
  "secrets": ["GITHUB_APP_KEY_B64"],
  "internet": true,
  "triggers": [{ "timer": { "everySeconds": 86400 } }],
  "limits": { "seconds": 900, "memory": "512MiB", "cpu": 1 }
} }
```

`internet: true` is what lets a run reach `api.github.com` and the log storage it redirects to. Then
`function_secret_set {name: "ci-analysis", key: "GITHUB_APP_KEY_B64", value: <base64 of the PEM>}`. `function_runs
{name, run}` shows a night's report. Read one at a time from a workstation, a repository of 630 runs a week took 3
minutes (711 requests) and one of 1072 runs about 4 minutes (1178 requests); the function reads its repositories side by
side within its 15 minutes.

## Tests
