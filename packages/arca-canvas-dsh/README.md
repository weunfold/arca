# Automagik Arca canvas for DSH

<a href="https://weunfold.ai/"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automagik-si/arca/6a9e309584460ce666f2802227a5de79799157d3/assets/open-intelligence/open-intelligence-badge-ink.svg" alt="Open Intelligence" width="170" height="32"></a>

A host plugin for stock DSH and an embedding DSH host. It polls Arca through a
Unix socket and serves a cached snapshot at `GET /arca-canvas/snapshot`.
`GET /arca-canvas` draws a workspace from the snapshot: a top bar with the project
picker, local clock and fleet summary; a machines strip with CPU, memory and one
line per GPU card; the selected project's cards on a dotted canvas with curved
SVG edges; and a Doctor panel with Chat and Steps tabs, recent Arca activity and
waiting approvals. Under the canvas, beside the Doctor panel, a foot carries the
Open Intelligence tag of the we unfold movement: an inline picture 170 px wide,
in one colour, the page's ink on the page's ground in light and dark, loaded from
nowhere and never a link. The tag belongs to [we unfold](https://weunfold.ai/) and is not under this
package's Apache licence; the Automagik Arca repository says where it comes from
in `assets/open-intelligence/`. A machine's Details dialog names who is using each
GPU and shows its services area. The Doctor composer is a working chat backed by
a persisted DSH session named
`Doctor` (model `deepseek-flash`). It works without a sidebar. The Doctor reads
Arca and can record one inert action proposal; it cannot change anything. The
owner approves a proposal with the passkey on a card inside the kernel-served
canvas.
When the sidebar is installed, an Arca canvas tab embeds this same page, sharing
its renderer, polling and styles.

## Install

Use Node **24.9.0 or newer** and **`@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.2.2-rc.1`** or **`0.2.2-rc.2`**:
the package was checked against those two exact releases (npm's `latest` and `next`
tags on 2026-11-12). DSH leaves out a plugin whose `engines.dsh` range its own version
does not meet, and counts prereleases when it compares: the range here is
`>=0.2.2-rc.1 <0.3.0-0`, which takes every 0.2.2 release from rc.1 on and no 0.3.0
prerelease. Install the package at an exact full commit containing this directory:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add -w "github:automagik-si/arca#<commit>&path:/packages/arca-canvas-dsh"
```

Replace `<profile>` and `<commit>` with the desired profile and full commit SHA.
The quotes keep `&path:` in the same argument. DSH forwards the arguments to
pnpm, whose git spec splits the commit and `path:` selectors at `&`. The built
`client.js`, `page.js` and `page.css` are committed, so the git-path install needs no build hook.

Use the same command with an embedding DSH host's profile. Fully quit that host
before editing its profile, and restart it afterwards. The package contributes
one `arca-canvas` row via `dsh.bundle.patch`; the host must provide `webServer`.
No sidebar provider is required.

## Configure

Set these keys in the inserted `arca-canvas` row's `config` map:

```yaml
config:
  socketPath: /run/arca/arca.sock
  viewerTokenPath: /path/to/arca-viewer.token
  pollMs: 5000
  nodeName: 'Example machine'
  address: ''
  approvalUrl: ''
  devicesUrl: ''
  devicesTokenPath: ''
  chatEnabled: true
  chatStatePath: ''
  dailyTokenBudget: 1000000
```

| Key | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `hosts` | Optional non-empty array of host readers, described below. |
| `socketPath` | Required when `hosts` is absent; absolute path to Arca's `listen.unix` socket. DSH must run as the same user as Arca. |
| `viewerTokenPath` | Required when `hosts` is absent; absolute path to a regular token file with mode exactly `0400`. Symlinks are refused. |
| `pollMs` | Integer delay between completed polls, at least 100 ms; default 5000. Arca polls never overlap; the device phase runs independently. |
| `nodeName` | Optional human machine title. Defaults to the host OS hostname; an empty or whitespace-only name becomes `Machine`. The raw Arca node ID is never the card title. |
| `address` | Optional LAN host name or IP for a service's Open link. Bare host or IP only, no scheme or port. When set, a service card gets `http://<address>:<lanPort>` only when the real `service_list` row has a `lanPort` host listener; a container port alone never becomes a link. Empty by default. |
| `chatEnabled` | Enable the Doctor chat routes. Default true; when false the chat routes answer 503 and no model is called. |
| `chatStatePath` | Optional absolute path of the persisted chat state (DSH session id, daily token counter and the panel transcript). Defaults to `$DSH_HOME/storages/arca-canvas-chat.json`. |
| `dailyTokenBudget` | Positive integer total-token budget per UTC day, default 1000000. When reached the Doctor answers with the daily-budget card and spends no model call. |
| `approvalUrl` | Optional absolute HTTP(S) URL of this deployment’s Arca `/approve` page, empty by default. URLs with credentials are refused. Delete plans link there; the proposal cards use the same-origin `/approve/plans` route on the kernel-served canvas. Without it the cards are unavailable and the badge is plain text. |
| `devicesUrl` | Optional absolute device service HTTP(S) MCP URL without credentials or fragments, empty by default. HTTPS permits any host. HTTP requires a literal loopback, RFC1918, CGNAT (100.64/10), or fd00::/8 address; hostnames and public addresses are refused. |
| `devicesTokenPath` | Optional absolute device reader token file path; requires a regular file with mode exactly `0400`, with symlinks refused. Empty by default. |
| `projects` | Optional owner project groups. Each entry has a unique non-empty `name`, an optional `domain`, and a non-empty `members` array of `{ host, incusProject, instance }`. Every member must name a configured host, and one instance can belong to only one project. |
| `defaultProject` | Optional project name selected on load. Otherwise the page selects the first configured project, then the first service project, then the first other Incus project. An internal Arca project is never selected. Must name a configured project when `projects` is present. |

To show multiple hosts, set `hosts` in the same config map:

```yaml
config:
  hosts:
    - name: alpha
      socketPath: /example/alpha/arca.sock
      viewerTokenPath: /example/alpha/viewer.token
      address: 192.0.2.10
      devicesUrl: https://devices.example.com/mcp
      devicesTokenPath: /example/alpha/device-reader.token
    - name: beta
      socketPath: /example/beta/arca.sock
      viewerTokenPath: /example/beta/viewer.token
  pollMs: 5000
  approvalUrl: https://example.com/approve
  defaultProject: Studio
  projects:
    - name: Studio
      domain: studio.example
      members:
        - { host: alpha, incusProject: service, instance: app }
        - { host: beta, incusProject: service, instance: api }
```

Each entry requires a non-empty, unique `name`, used as its machine card and
project host title, and absolute `socketPath` and `viewerTokenPath` paths. Token
files follow the same regular-file, `0400`, no-symlink rules. Optional
`devicesUrl` and `devicesTokenPath` use the same validation rules as the
top-level settings. Hosts appear in array order; the first is the **primary**
host. If its device settings are omitted, it uses the existing top-level device
settings. Other hosts never inherit those settings. Devices are collected for
compatibility but are not drawn in this layout.

When `hosts` is absent, the existing single-host keys work unchanged: the name
comes from `nodeName` or the OS hostname. With `hosts` present, each entry supplies
its own socket, token and name; top-level `socketPath`, `viewerTokenPath` and
`nodeName` are unused. Each host polls concurrently on its own `pollMs` schedule.
An unreachable socket, refused token or failed tool affects only that host;
successful fields and the other hosts keep rendering. A failed watch report
leaves the machine card online but reports that its instance count is unknown;
configured owner-project members on that host are reported as unknown, never as
missing or as an empty host. No per-host mode is inferred from `arca_status`.

`projects` is the owner's grouping layer, not an Incus project list. A listed
member is resolved on its host and appears only inside its owner project. An
unlisted instance falls back to a project named after its Incus project on that
host, with one exception: the internal `arcak-svc` grouping is never a project.
Each unlisted instance in `arcak-svc` becomes its own project named after the
service (the instance name, humanized; `web1` becomes `Web1`), so a
service is a first-class project by default and an owner project can group
several. The internal `arcak-svc` id never appears as a project, in the picker or
in a project subtitle. To group services, list them like any other member:
`{ host: alpha, incusProject: arcak-svc, instance: web1 }`. An Incus
project whose instances are all listed in owner projects is not rendered at all.
Owner projects render in config order; service projects follow, then the other
fallback projects by host and project name, with the host appended only when a
display name collides.

All example paths must be replaced with paths on the machine running DSH. Paths
are literal; `~` and environment variables are not expanded. Config contains
file paths, never bearer values. An unreachable Arca or missing token does not
prevent the plugin from serving its page and an error snapshot.

Mint a viewer token using the existing Arca configuration:

```sh
arca token mint --scope viewer --id canvas-viewer \
  --out /path/to/arca-viewer.token --config /path/to/arca.json
```

Arca writes the secret directly into a new `0400` file and stores its hash in the
configured token directory. Existing files and token IDs are refused. The plugin
reads the token again before **each HTTP request**, including `initialize`; token
rotation therefore takes effect without restarting DSH. It never sends `Origin`.

The route is served on the DSH listener and inherits that listener's access
boundary. It contains machine data; expose the DSH listener only to its intended
readers.

## Snapshot

The JSON object has `at` (ISO timestamp), `approvalUrl` (empty or the configured
approval URL), `pageHost` (the first configured host, whose kernel serves the
canvas and its approval origin), `projects` (the configured owner groups, each
with `name`, `domain` and `members`), `defaultProject`, and `hosts` in configured
order. Each
host entry has `name`, `address` (the configured LAN address or empty), `at`,
`error` (null or safe error text), `nodeName`
(resolved by the host), `machine`, `instances`, `instancesKnown` (false when
`watch_report` failed), `projects` (the Incus project ids from `watch_report`),
`databases`, `services`, `servicesKnown` (false when `service_list` failed),
`metrics`, `osUpdate`, `osUpdateRead`, `alerts`, `plans`, `journal`, `journalKnown` (false when
`journal_list` failed), `journalPending` (true while a deep journal read finishes
in the background), `devices`, `devicesAt` (ISO time of the last good device
list, or null), `phones`, and `desktops`. `devices` is `off`, `ok`, `unavailable`,
`unreachable`, or `stale`.

- `machine` and `metrics` hold `arca_status` and `node_metrics` results.
- `osUpdate` holds the `os_update` result (the node's OS version, update channel, check frequency, automatic updates,
  last check and update, the OS's error kind and update-key trust), or null. `osUpdateRead` is `ok`, `missing` (the
  kernel has no `os_update`: an older kernel), `failed` (the read did not complete this poll) or `pending`. It never
  adds to `error`.
- `instances` flattens `watch_report.projects[].instances[]`, adding `project`.
- `databases` and `plans` contain the arrays from `postgres_list` and `plan_list`.
- `services` holds the `service_list.services` rows (name, template, state, ipv4, ports,
  lanPort, links, published). `lanPort` is the template's host proxy port, or null when the
  service has no lan listener. A service whose instance is on the canvas contributes an Open
  link only from the configured host `address` and its real `lanPort`.
  A row that `service_list` marks with `update.state` `differs` (the template installed on
  the node names another version than the one the service runs) gets the tag "Other version"
  on its card and beside its name in the machine's Details. The words claim no order: two
  digests do not say which is newer. No other row carries the tag.
- `journal` holds the newest `journal_list` records, at most 200 per host. Every
  poll re-reads a trailing window of the newest ids and merges by id with the
  latest record winning, so an effect that moved from `Intent` to `Failed` (or
  `Applied` to `Confirmed`/`Reverted`) updates instead of staying at the first
  state it was seen in. A snapshot waits for at most two journal pages and a deep
  first read finishes in the background with `journalPending` true meanwhile. A
  journal that restarts from zero (its ids go backwards or disappear) is detected
  and re-read from the start, dropping the stale cache for that host. The newest
  records across hosts feed the Doctor's Chat and Steps views. A failed journal
  read leaves the array empty and `journalKnown` false, so the page shows an
  unavailable notice instead of invented rows.
- `alerts` holds the full `alerts_list` result, preserving firing, unknown and
  recent resolved alerts plus health metadata. This layout does not draw alert
  cards yet; the data stays in the snapshot for later phases.

Failed reads leave `machine`/`metrics` null or the other fields empty arrays.
Successful reads survive partial failures. Requests use MCP protocol
`2025-11-25`, `initialize` then `tools/call`, over HTTP POST to `/mcp`. Error
messages omit upstream bodies and filesystem details, and successful payloads
are scrubbed of any bearer echo. Snapshot strings are never inserted as HTML.

The optional device reader uses HTTP POST to the exact configured `devicesUrl`,
with the same protocol and initialization sequence and its own per-request bearer.
It calls only `droid_list`, `desktop_list`, `droidd_status` and `phone_status`.
Structured list results use `droids` and `desktops` keys; older JSON text results
are also accepted. Phone entries retain name, state, network type, battery level
and screen size (`[width, height]`); desktop entries retain name, status and memory limit.
Every phone is eligible for a status read regardless of its `droid_list` state;
one phase reads at most two phone statuses, rotating through the list. A failed or
timed-out phone is kept with `state: 'unreachable'` and is not retried for at
least sixty seconds; the skip is based on that last call failure, never on
`droid_list` state. Both device settings empty means `devices: 'off'`, with no
device requests. Configured readers report `ok` after a successful phase, or
`unavailable` on invalid settings, missing/refused tokens, an unreachable service
or a first failed read with no prior good list. Device validation happens in the
host reader and never prevents canvas startup. Refused settings make no device
HTTP requests. A failed list or service-status read keeps the last good phone and
desktop list and reports `devices: 'unreachable'`; a failed `phone_status` keeps
that phone visible with `state: 'unreachable'`, alongside all other phones and
desktops. An HTTP 429 keeps the last good list and reports `devices: 'stale'`;
`devicesAt` preserves the time of that list, and the topbar chip shows its age.
With no prior good list, even a 429 reports `unavailable` with empty lists.

Device reads start alongside Arca reads and update cached device cards in the
background under one five-second deadline. The phase is single-flight: a poll
never starts another phase while one is pending. Arca snapshots and paints never
wait for that phase. In-flight device requests are aborted on deadline or host
stop; a later poll may retry except for a phone still inside its sixty-second
failure window. A muted `Devices unavailable`, `Devices unreachable` or aged
`Devices stale` topbar chip appears for those states, with no device error banner.
The host logs one safe line per device state change, naming `devicesUrl` or
`devicesTokenPath` for a rejected setting. Setting values, device credentials and
upstream error details never enter logs, the snapshot or the browser bundle. Arca
reads keep their existing error behavior.

The top bar's **Fleet** link, beside the project picker, opens the Fleet updates view (`#fleet`; Back returns to the
project shown before). It is read only: one row per configured host, in config order, with the OS version, channel and
check frequency (`stable · every 6h`), automatic updates On/Off, the last successful check as an age, the last update
(`version · age`, or `none seen yet`) and the last error kind in words. A row carries at most one warning, in this order:
the update key is not trusted (with both CA fingerprints and the count of failed checks in a row), the node does not report
update state (not Arca OS, or an older kernel), an update waiting for a restart or a version behind the newest one on the
fleet's same channel (the update server's own newest version is not reported yet), automatic updates off, and no
successful check for twice the check frequency (at least an hour). A row whose read failed says "Could not read the update
state just now." The line above the table gives the newest read time and how many nodes report update state.

The page has four regions. The top bar holds the project picker, the
`Arca self-hosted | Arca Cloud` segmented control (Cloud is disabled and marked
coming soon), the local clock and a fleet summary computed from the latest
`node_metrics` (`machines · cores · GB`; a part disappears when no host reports
it). The machines strip draws one compact card per configured host with online
state from `arca_status.incusReachable`, a CPU bar from `latest.cpu.usedPct`
(shown as used cores / total cores), a memory bar from
`memory.totalBytes` and `usedBytes` (falling back to `totalBytes -
availableBytes`), and the instance count. The card trusts `cpu.coresKnown`: a
known count is always shown, even when `cpu.reason` explains why the load is
absent. A null CPU load renders `CPU n/a` as `n/a / N cores` with no bar, never
zero. An unknown core count, from `coresKnown: false` or an older snapshot
whose `cores` is zero, says `cores n/a`. Whenever the card has no CPU load, the
host's `reason` is the meter's tooltip, so a known count can keep the tooltip
too. A memory `reason` renders `Mem n/a` with the same tooltip and no bar.
A real reading is never replaced by an invented one.
Two dashed placeholder cards leave room for storage and phones. The project
canvas draws the selected project's instances and matched databases as cards
connected to a project hub with curved dashed SVG edges on the dotted canvas.
Cards carry only real snapshot data: status, kind, owner class, the instance's
own absolute URL when present, and database address, port and link count when
present. A domain card appears only when the project config sets `domain`.

A machine card draws one line per `node_metrics.latest.gpu.cards[]` entry under
CPU and Mem. Cards are sorted by PCI and every card gets its own slot number, so
a unique card reads `GPU 1 · 4060 Ti` and two identical cards read
`GPU 1 · 4060 Ti` / `GPU 2 · 4060 Ti`; every line's tooltip names the exact PCI
address. The line shows utilization as a whole percentage, a VRAM bar and
used/total GB from telemetry. Memory and VRAM use 1024-based GB, so a 16 GiB
card reads `16 GB`; disks keep decimal GB to match their labels. A card with no
telemetry shows its card name and the kernel's plain `reason` instead, never an
invented 0%. A card is marked "held back by its power limit" only when
`telemetry.eventReasons` has the SW power cap bit (0x4). A host whose
`gpu.cards` is empty draws no GPU line, unless `gpu.reason` says the inventory
read failed: then one GPU line carries that reason.

The machine Details dialog repeats every card with its PCI address, driver,
VRAM, power (W), temperature (°C) and clock, then lists who is using it: the
Incus project and instance (with a Docker container id when the process runs in
one), a host Docker container, or "on the host", each with its own VRAM in GB.
Its services area lists the machine's services. A failed `service_list` on a
normal host says "Services could not be read just now", never "No services".
When `arca_status.mode` is `watch-only` it instead says "Arca watches this
machine; it doesn't run services here yet" and shows no service error, because
the kernel refuses service reads by design in that mode. That expected refusal
is also the only read hidden from the strip's "Partial data" warning; another
failed read on a watch-only machine still shows it.

The right-hand Doctor panel has Chat and Steps tabs. Chat is a real
conversation; Steps renders the newest `journal_list` records across every
machine. A waiting action proposal is an approval card in Steps, and also under
the Doctor message that proposed it. A delete plan keeps the count-and-link card
to the configured `approvalUrl`. When `journal_list` is unavailable Steps says so
without fabricating activity.

The Doctor has the fifteen read-only Arca tools (`arca_status`, `watch_report`,
`postgres_list`, `node_metrics`, `alerts_list`, `plan_list`, `journal_list`,
`service_list`, `storage_list`, `snapshot_list`, `tenant_list`, `tenant_status`,
`tenant_usage`, `function_list`, `function_runs`) plus one non-read tool,
`arca_propose`. `arca_propose` calls the kernel's `action_propose` viewer verb and
records an inert proposal for one of twenty-two actions (`service_create`,
`service_remove`, `service_import`, `service_release`, `service_publish`,
`service_unpublish`, `service_connect`, `service_disconnect`, `postgres_create`, `gpu_attach`, `gpu_detach`,
`storage_add`, `snapshot_create`, `snapshot_delete`, `instance_start`,
`instance_stop`, `instance_restart`, `tenant_create`, `tenant_remove`,
`deploy_remove`, `function_create`, `function_remove`); it changes nothing and a
database delete cannot be proposed. `service_import` and `service_release` take
`{name}`: an import takes over, where it stands, a service another manager
created, and a release gives it back. The three instance actions take
`{project, instance}` and only for an instance Arca owns or has adopted; a stop
and a restart are graceful, and their cards wait up to 180 seconds for the
kernel's answer. `tenant_status` and `tenant_usage` take a tenant's `id`, and
`function_runs` a function's `name` (with an optional `limit` of at most 100 or
one `run`); each read sends the kernel only those. `tenant_usage` names the
deploy each instance came from, which is what a `deploy_remove {tenant, deploy}`
needs. The cards of `tenant_remove`, `deploy_remove` and `function_remove` delete
data or secrets for good and are drawn in the alert colour (`data-destructive`),
summary and Approve button included. A `storage_add` card for a whole disk always
says "Everything on this disk will be erased." The `storage_list` and
`snapshot_list` sizes reach the model as decimal GB. `arca_propose` may
target `pageHost`, the host whose kernel serves this canvas and its approval
page, and any configured reader whose name the page host's `arca_status` lists in
`approval.linkedHosts` (another kernel whose approvals the page host relays, on
the same machine or on another machine whose socket is forwarded to the page
host; both are treated alike). Any other host is refused before a proposal is recorded, with
the plain reason "this machine is not linked for approvals yet"; a page host
whose status cannot be read links nothing. The proposal is recorded by the
target host's own kernel, which later verifies the owner's passkey itself. The tools are
registered globally with a per-session `when` condition, the Doctor's scope is
restricted with `restrict({ allow: DOCTOR_TOOLS })` (the fifteen reads plus
`arca_propose`), and scoped `tools/pre-execute` and `tools.guard` checks deny every
other name (including the reserved `run_code`) at dispatch. A setup that cannot
install the restriction and guard, or enumerate its tools, fails after the
`start` event, so the chat sends a fixed "The Doctor could not answer." SSE error
event and makes no model call. Every write verb is still never registered. The
page never receives a model credential.

For a change request the model calls `arca_propose`, then tells the owner in one
plain sentence what will happen and to tap Approve on the card. It must never
claim the change is done before the result arrives. `postgres_create` never
carries a container image: the kernel picks its default.

The Doctor speaks to a non-technical owner: short plain sentences, no markdown
tables, headings or code fences, sizes in GB with one decimal and percentages as
whole numbers. Memory and VRAM use 1024-based GB (a 16 GiB card reads 16 GB);
disks keep decimal GB to match their labels. Tool results reach the model in
that same form. Metrics arrive as a short plain-text summary (memory used,
available and total in GB, rounded CPU percentages, plain labels), and a figure
the host cannot report is shown as `not measurable from here` rather than an
internal reason. GPU cards reach the model with their slot and exact PCI address
(`GPU 2 (4060 Ti, PCI 0000:02:00.0): ...`), utilization, VRAM, power and
temperature, plus who is using each card by project/instance, Docker container
or "on the host" and that user's VRAM in GB, so the Doctor can answer "who is
using the GPU" and name the right identical card. Byte fields in every other
read result are disk-like decimal GB, network rates pick KB/s, MB/s or GB/s, and
percentages become whole numbers, so the model never sees a raw byte count it
could repeat. Alert reasons are translated to plain words; a resolved alert
keeps its own resolution instead of reading like a different one.

Selection lives in the URL fragment as `#project/<name>`, encoded with
`encodeURIComponent`. Loading with a known project restores it; an unknown or
missing fragment selects `defaultProject`, else the first configured project,
then the first service project, then the first other Incus project, and replaces
the fragment. The page never pans, zooms or drags. Polls rebuild a region only
when its data changed, so selection, focus and scroll survive unchanged polls.
No write verb is exposed. The only non-read tool records an inert proposal, and
the package adds no routes beyond the existing `/arca-canvas` assets and
snapshot.

## Approval cards

The canvas page at `/approve/canvas` is this package's DSH page relayed by the
kernel from the DSH listener. The card uses the page's own origin: it reads
`GET /approve/plans` and posts to `POST /approve/approve` and
`POST /approve/decline`, which are kernel routes on the approval origin and are
never proxied through DSH. A page opened directly from the DSH listener has no
`/approve/plans`, so it keeps the waiting count and the configured approval link
instead of an action card.

The trust claim is precise: the card protects against model text and chat data.
Those cannot choose its summary, details, host, action, digest or target, and
cannot make the owner sign a different kernel statement. It is **not** a defence
against a compromised DSH: a DSH that can rewrite this page's JavaScript can
mislead the owner. The passkey still binds the approval to the kernel's
`statement`, so such a page cannot change the action the kernel verifies without
the owner signing that statement.

An approval card shows, from the kernel's `/approve/plans` row matched by id:

- the **host from the signed statement**, so two hosts with the same action and
  arguments (the id hashes only those) are never confused; the card signature
  includes it, so a changed host re-renders the card;
- for `gpu_attach` / `gpu_detach`, a page-built **Slot** row next to Host, which
  maps the proposal's PCI address through the page host's dashboard inventory
  (for example `GPU 2 on alpha (0000:02:00.0)`) so two identical cards are
  unmistakable. The signed statement's host name (`alpha.example`) is not
  compared with the dashboard name (`alpha`); a plan from `/approve/plans` is
  always the page kernel's own plan, and a PCI absent from that inventory draws
  no Slot row;
- the kernel-built `summary`, as text;
- every `details` row (`label` and `value`) in kernel order, as text;
- the action, the target id and the first 12 hex characters of `argsDigest`;
- a live expiry countdown and Approve / Decline buttons.

All text is assigned with `textContent`; no kernel field is parsed as markup. A
row without a string `label` and `value` fails the whole proposal closed, so a
card is never shown with a missing behaviour-changing argument. A proposal whose
action is not one of the nine allowed actions (for example an older
`postgres_delete`) is not rendered. The card parses the `statement` and drops the
proposal unless `statement.target` is the entry id, `statement.action` is the
entry action and `statement.paramsDigest` is the entry `argsDigest`. A GPU
proposal's rows are the kernel's `Project`, `Instance` (with its type), `GPU`
(product and exact PCI address) and `Effect`; the Effect sentence is the safety
text and is shown exactly as sent, never shortened.

A proposal id reaches the panel only from a real `arca_propose` tool result, and
it only selects which kernel row to draw. A chat card is attached only when the
tool ran on `pageHost` and the page kernel listed that id, or when the tool ran
on a host that `/approve/plans` lists in `linkedHosts` and the page kernel
listed a row with that `linkedHost` and id. The same change on two machines has
the same id, so a linked machine's card is keyed `<host>|<id>` and keeps its own
state; its Host row shows the host its statement names, and Approve and Decline
send `host` so the page host relays them to that machine. A row naming a
`linkedHost` the answer does not list is dropped. An id the kernel did
not list draws no card; the panel says "The proposal is not waiting any more."
A foreign host's tool event never attaches this page's row. Model text never
supplies a card field: a contradicting or hostile answer cannot change what the
owner signs. The kernel row must carry a `statement`; the card signs exactly that
string.

Approve reads the trusted credential ids from `GET /approve` and calls
`navigator.credentials.get` exactly like the approval page: `rpId` is
`location.hostname`, `userVerification` is `required`, and the challenge is
`SHA-256("arca-kernel-approval/v1\narca-kernel-approve\n" + statement)`.
The proof is the page's WebAuthn proof object. The POST body is exactly
`{"plan":"act-<12 hex>","approval":"<base64 statement>.<base64 proof>"}`.
Decline posts exactly `{"plan":"act-<12 hex>"}`. Only `act-*` ids can be declined
from a card.

States are `waiting`, `approving` (the passkey prompt), `done` (the verb's result
in plain words), `declined`, `expired` and `failed` (a plain reason). A cancelled
passkey prompt returns the card to `waiting`. A failed approval whose entry is
still listed becomes `waiting` again with a Retry button; a new waiting entry
with the same id after a decline is waiting again. An approve POST that gets no
answer after 30 seconds (180 for an instance start, stop or restart) returns to `waiting` with "No answer from Arca, try
again." A `NoSuchPlan` answer says the proposal may have been approved or
declined elsewhere and points at Steps, never "Nothing changed". Every kernel
approval refusal code has its own plain sentence. A refusal after the passkey
was spent is the action handler's own snake_case refusal: the card says the
change was approved but Arca could not run it, with the handler's message, and
keeps no Retry. An empty or unreadable 400/500 says only that Arca could not
finish it and points at Steps, without claiming either outcome or suggesting a
retry. Each finished card records when it settled: a poll that started before
that moment cannot put it back to waiting, while a later poll that lists the id
again (a re-proposal) can. While a card is open, the page refreshes
`/approve/plans` with the snapshot poll; an expired card disables its buttons and
says nothing changed.

## Doctor chat contract

The Doctor chat is served by this package on the DSH listener. The kernel proxies
the two routes behind the `__Host-arca-canvas` passkey cookie and its `Origin`
check, then relays the stream. The DSH routes themselves are loopback-only and
trust the kernel's gate; they read no cookie and hold no page secret. A direct
loopback caller is inside the same trust boundary as the snapshot route.

### `POST /arca-canvas/chat`

One Doctor turn. The kernel exposes it as `POST /approve/canvas/chat`.

- Request `Content-Type: application/json`; UTF-8 body `{ "message": "<text>" }`.
  The body is capped at 64 KiB and the message at 16384 characters.
- Success is `200 text/event-stream; charset=utf-8` (`Cache-Control: no-store`,
  `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, `Connection: keep-alive`). Every frame is `event:
  <name>` plus exactly one `data: <json>` line; `JSON.stringify` escapes every
  newline inside a string, so model text can never close a frame or forge an
  event. A comment line `: hb` is written at least every 15 seconds, including
  while a tool call is slow, so the kernel's 60-second idle limit is never
  reached. The turn is bounded at nine minutes, under the kernel's ten; agent setup is bounded
separately, and the single-turn slot is released only after the DSH run reports
`turn/end` (or its cancel bound expires). A client that disconnects during setup
gets no model call.
- Refusals before a stream are JSON: `400 { "error": "invalid-json" |
  "message-required" }`, `405 { "error": "method-not-allowed" }` (with
  `Allow: POST`), `413 { "error": "body-too-large" | "message-too-long" }`,
  `415 { "error": "json-required" }`, `429 { "error": "chat-busy" }` (one turn
  at a time), and `503 { "error": "chat-unavailable" }` (missing DSH agent/tools
  before the stream starts, or the plugin is shutting down). None of these starts
  a model call. A setup failure after `start` (the tool registry cannot restrict
  or enumerate, or setup times out) is instead a `200` SSE stream with a fixed
  `error` event and `done { "reason": "error" }`; it also makes no model call.

SSE events, in order. Every `data` is one JSON object.

| Event | Data | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start` | `{ "session": "Doctor", "sessionId"?: "<dsh-session-id>" }` | Always first, sent before agent or model work so the kernel's idle timer never starts on a silent socket. `sessionId` is present when a persisted session is already known. |
| `text` | `{ "text": "<delta>" }` | One assistant text delta; concatenate in arrival order. |
| `tool` | `{ "callId", "name", "state", "input"?, "summary"?, "host"?, "proposal"? }` | One card per real tool dispatch. `state` is `running`, then `done` or `error`; `name` is one of the fifteen reads or `arca_propose`. `proposal` is `{ "id": "act-<12 hex>" }` when the kernel accepted an action proposal. |
| `usage` | `{ "turnToolCalls", "turnOutputTokens", "dailyTokens", "dailyBudget", "day" }` | Token accounting from the model's own usage; `dailyTokens` counts input plus output for the UTC day. |
| `budget` | `{ "scope": "daily", "used", "budget", "message" }` | Daily budget reached; the message is `Daily budget reached, try tomorrow.`. The turn then ends. |
| `cap` | `{ "reason", "limit", "message" }` | Per-turn cap reached: `reason` is `tool-calls` (40) or `output-tokens` (64000). |
| `error` | `{ "message": "<safe text>" }` | Safe, fixed text; upstream details and the model key never enter the stream. |
| `done` | `{ "reason", "turnToolCalls", "turnOutputTokens" }` | Terminal. `reason` is `complete`, `tool-calls`, `output-tokens`, `budget`, `timeout`, `error`, or `closed`. |

A stream always ends cleanly. A client must treat an `event: arca-cut` added by
the kernel as advisory (`The answer was cut off.`) and must also show that
notice when the stream ends without `done`; the kernel's cut is never a security
decision. Caps are enforced from the model's own usage and the tool dispatcher:
a 41st tool call fails before dispatch and the turn ends with `tool-calls`; more
than 64000 output tokens ends it with `output-tokens`; the daily counter persists
in `chatStatePath` and blocks the next turn before any model call.

### `GET /arca-canvas/chat/history`

The kernel exposes it as `GET /approve/canvas/chat/history`. Plain JSON, no
model call:

```json
{
  "session": { "id": "<dsh-session-id>", "name": "Doctor" },
  "messages": [
    { "role": "user", "text": "...", "at": "<ISO time>" },
    { "role": "assistant", "text": "...", "at": "<ISO time>",
      "tools": [{ "callId": "...", "name": "arca_status", "state": "done",
                 "host": "alpha", "summary": "...",
                 "proposal"?: { "id": "act-<12 hex>" } }] }
  ],
  "usage": { "day": "YYYY-MM-DD", "dailyTokens": 0, "dailyBudget": 1000000,
             "budgetExhausted": false },
  "limits": { "toolCallsPerTurn": 40, "outputTokensPerTurn": 64000 }
}
```

`tools[].host`, `tools[].summary` and `tools[].proposal` are optional. A `proposal` is kept in the panel replay so the same kernel card returns after a reload. `session` is `null` before the first turn.
The transcript is capped at the newest
200 messages and the body is kept under 1.5 MiB (oldest replay rows are dropped)
so it fits the kernel's 2 MiB forward cap. The model transcript itself is the
persisted DSH session; this JSON is the panel's replay.

### Session, model, and credential

The first turn resumes the persisted session id in `chatStatePath`, or creates one
and names it `Doctor`; later turns and restarts reuse it. The route selects the
DSH model `deepseek-flash` on the `deepseek-official` provider from the runtime's
own credentials. The plugin never reads, receives, logs or returns that
credential; it appears in no page asset, SSE frame, snapshot or log line. Message
bodies are never logged either. A model credential failure becomes the safe
`error` event.

## Develop

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium
npx -y node@24.11.0 --test
npx -y node@24.11.0 build.mjs
git diff --exit-code -- client.js page.js page.css
```

One test runs against a real DSH and is skipped unless it is given one:

```sh
ARCA_REAL_DSH_PROOF=/path/to/dsh npx -y node@24.11.0 --test test/real-host.test.js
```

`pnpm` must be beside that `dsh` or on `PATH`. The test installs this package's
shipped files into a profile in a temporary home, starts the harness on a free
loopback port, and fetches the canvas page, its snapshot and its chat history.
It fails when the harness leaves the plugin out, as it does for a version the
`engines.dsh` range refuses. The harness gets none of the caller's environment,
and no model is asked. Run it against each DSH release before the range is
changed to let that release in: every other test stands in for the host.

Tests use fixture data, temporary Unix sockets and an ephemeral loopback browser
server. Playwright 1.64.0 is pinned to the Chromium used by the rendering checks.
The tests assert light/dark colors, layout regions and literal rendering of
untrusted strings in a real browser. They also rebuild every browser artifact
into a temporary directory and compare SHA-256 hashes. Chat tests use a fake
DSH agent/stream and the synthetic Arca socket fixtures: they cover streamed
text, one card per real call, the inert proposal tool and the full allow-list,
the approval card's kernel-only text, exact approve and decline bodies, the
host row and statement integrity, a foreign host and an unknown id, expiry,
action refusal, retry, NoSuchPlan, a hanging approval timeout, passkey
cancellation, the tool and token caps, the daily budget, the persisted `Doctor`
session, and the absence of the model key from the page. GPU tests cover
PCI-sorted slots for identical cards, the Doctor's slot+PCI card identity, a
remote host with inventory only, no GPU, a failed GPU inventory read, telemetry
with a reason, process owners of every kind, binary 16 GB VRAM, a watch-only
services area and its partial-data rule, a failed service read on a normal host,
the power-cap bit, the page-built Slot row, and the whole GPU approval-card rows
including the Effect sentence.

`npm run build` regenerates the browser module and standalone page assets using
exact-pinned esbuild. Commit all three artifacts with browser-source changes.
Set `ARCA_CANVAS_EVIDENCE_DIR` to an existing directory to save the browser test’s
1440×900 light/dark screenshots (`canvas-v28-light.png`, `canvas-v28-dark.png`,
`approval-card-waiting-light.png`, `approval-card-waiting-dark.png`,
`approval-card-done-light.png`, `approval-card-done-dark.png`)
and `rectangles.json` outside the repository. The GPU browser test saves the
two-card machine strip as `canvas-gpu-strip-light.png` and
`canvas-gpu-strip-dark.png`, plus detail and GPU approval shots. The standard
browser fixture has
two hosts, two owner projects, one service project, one fallback project,
real-shaped journal rows, one waiting delete plan and eight waiting action proposals
(including a hostile row, a mismatched statement, a foreign-host candidate and an old
database-delete row the card must not draw).

The client contract is pinned to the sidebar’s 0.24.1 API: package metadata uses
`dsh.client.inject: ["dsh-better-sidebar"]` (package IDs), while the client exports
`inject = ['betterSidebar']` (Cordis service names). DSH calls `apply(ctx)`;
`ctx.betterSidebar.registerTab({ id, title, component })` returns the disposer
owned by `ctx.effect`. The React component uses DSH’s module-loader `react`
export, without bundling a second React. It returns a same-origin frame of
`/arca-canvas`. Without the sidebar, Cordis leaves this client consumer waiting;
the host still starts with only `inject = ['webServer']` and serves the page.
The client also guards a missing service when invoked directly.
