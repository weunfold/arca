//! Arca's host sampler. It reads the node's procfs and sysfs trees when its Incus is the local daemon, and asks Incus for the
//! host totals of a remote machine, the storage pools its allow-filter admits, and the instances per project with GET requests
//! only. Each sample is served in the `node_metrics` shape, and no sample carries a renter gate. [`Readings`] keeps what Incus
//! answered at the latest sample, with a `None` for each read that failed, the newest latency probe round, and the incus-osd
//! update and Secure Boot reading.
