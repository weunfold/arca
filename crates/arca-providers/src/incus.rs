//! The kernel's Incus write provider. It is the only code path in the kernel that writes to Incus. It sends only the writer's
//! checked requests: a POST for a create, a config change under an `If-Match` (a PATCH, or for a project a PUT of its whole
//! config), one ACL rule array under `If-Match`, and the tombstone-then-DELETE sequence for a retirement. Each effect is planned read-only first. `plan` refuses
//! before anything is journalled, and `effect` checks the family, the features, the ownership and the plan again before it
//! applies anything. `docs/OWNERSHIP.md` states the rules.
//!
//! A write that Incus answered with an error, or that did not finish, may still have landed. The provider reads the object back
//! before it decides the outcome, unless the answer could not be read at all: then it makes no read, since a read after a write
//! still running proves nothing. It reports a failure only when the object shows the write did not happen, and reports
//! [`EffectRefusal::Unresolved`] for anything it cannot prove either way.
//!
//! The read-back that settles an intent after a restart, or finds a removed entry's object gone, reads the object only once no
//! operation Incus still runs that may write it names it: it waits on each such operation up to the operation deadline, and an
//! operation still running then, or an operations listing that cannot be read, is [`EffectRefusal::Unresolved`]. An exec or a
//! console session, and a token operation, write nothing and hold nothing (`arca_incus::RunningOp::may_write`).
