//! Arca's Incus access. The read client sends only GET. The journal writer changes kernel-family objects under ownership
//! checks. The adoption writer has its separate closed migration table. The device assigner changes only one existing
//! instance's `devices` map, only for a kernel-family instance after the owner approved an action proposal; it is not part
//! of the desired-state journal. The import writer sets or clears one key, the kernel's entry mark, on an instance the
//! configuration allowlists in another manager's project, and sends nothing else. The state changer starts, gracefully stops or gracefully restarts one existing kernel-family
//! instance and writes nothing else. The snapshot writer adds snapshot pools and copies apps and data volumes into its own
//! `arcak-snapshots` project after the owner approved it (a host folder through a short-lived copy helper container
//! there), and writes nowhere else. The
//! service exec module adds only closed commands, fixed file destinations and exact recording cleanup; it is called by
//! serve's audited seam, never by Provider or plugins.
//! The recording shim refuses every method except GET. The fake serves fixtures and accepts writes only in memory.
