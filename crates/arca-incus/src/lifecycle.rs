//! Starting, stopping and restarting one existing instance, outside the desired-state journal.
//!
//! An instance's power state is not a desired-state entry: it is a live change to one existing instance. The kernel's own
//! writer is entry-scoped, so this module is a separate, deliberately narrow path, as the device assigner is. It reads one
//! instance and writes only its `state`: a `start`, a graceful `stop` or a graceful `restart`. It never creates, deletes,
//! renames or reconfigures an instance, never forces a stop, and refuses a project outside the kernel family it was built
//! with before any request. Whether the instance is the kernel's own is the caller's check, made on the row this module
//! read.
