//! A fake Incus for tests. It holds the objects of a [`FakeState`] in memory and serves them on a unix socket. It records every
//! request it receives.
//!
//! GET routes: `/1.0`, `/1.0/projects?recursion=1`, `/1.0/instances?all-projects=true&recursion=1`,
//! `/1.0/instances?all-projects=true&recursion=2`, `/1.0/storage-pools?recursion=1`, `/1.0/storage-pools/<pool>` (its driver set by
//! [`FakeIncus::set_pool_driver`]), `/1.0/storage-pools/<pool>/resources`,
//! `/1.0/networks?recursion=1` and `/1.0/networks/<name>/state` (the host's interfaces, set by
//! [`FakeIncus::set_host_interfaces`]), every object path, `/1.0/operations?all-projects=true&recursion=1`, and
//! `/1.0/operations/<id>` with its `/wait`. Any other GET is 404.
//!
//! The `recursion=2` instance listing is the `recursion=1` rows, each with a `state` object. A running instance's `state` holds
//! `cpu.usage` (nanoseconds) and `memory.usage` (bytes), set by [`FakeIncus::set_instance_usage`] and zero until a test sets them.
//! A running instance's cards are in its `state` only when [`FakeIncus::set_live_network`] set them. A stopped instance's `state` is `null`. [`FakeIncus::set_last_used`] sets an instance's `last_used_at`, as a start does.
//!
//! Operations: the listing groups every operation the fake holds by its status in lower case, as Incus does. A held operation
//! ([`FakeIncus::hold_operation`], [`FakeIncus::hold_create`]) stays running (status code 103) and names its object in
//! `resources`, rendered as Incus renders it: the object's path, with `?project=<p>` unless the project is `default`. It ends
//! only when the test releases it ([`FakeIncus::release_operation`]) or fails it ([`FakeIncus::fail_operation`]). A held
//! operation is of class `task` unless the test gives it the class and the description Incus gives an operation of another type
//! ([`FakeIncus::hold_operation_as`]). A wait on a running operation is held until the operation ends or its `timeout` passes,
//! but never longer than a quarter second, so a test is not slowed; a caller loops on a wait anyway, since Incus answers a
//! timed-out wait with the operation still running. [`FakeIncus::answer_wait_ended`] makes a wait disagree with the listing.
//!
//! A network, a forward and an ACL are served from the default project unless their project enables `features.networks`, as Incus
//! 7.3 serves them: a create sent to such a project lands in the default project, and a read sent to it is answered from there.
//!
//! Images live in an image store: a project's own when its config sets `features.images` to `"true"`, and the default project's
//! otherwise. `/1.0/images?project=<p>&recursion=1` lists the store the project reads, and `/1.0/images/<fingerprint>` is read
//! and deleted there; an image's delete is answered with an operation. An instance whose source names a `server` pulls its image
//! into the store its project reads, as a cached image, and a local alias is not checked. A project that holds an image is not
//! empty, so its delete is refused, as Incus refuses it. [`FakeIncus::add_image`] puts an image in a store, as a copy by hand would. A restricted project refuses an instance whose NIC names a network that its `restricted.networks.access` does not list.
//!
//! Writes: a POST to a collection creates an object, a PATCH or DELETE changes or removes one. These cover projects and the
//! eight object kinds (instances, networks, ACLs, profiles, volumes, zones, forwards and buckets). An instance gets a uuid, in
//! its `volatile.uuid` key; no other kind has one, a volume included, as on Incus 7.3. Each object's ETag is a digest of its JSON. A PATCH whose
//! `If-Match` is not the current ETag is 412 and changes nothing. A DELETE ignores `If-Match`, as Incus does. An instance's or
//! a volume's create and delete are answered 202 with an operation, whose URL the caller waits on. Every other write, and
//! every PATCH, is answered sync: 201 for a create and 200 otherwise. A failed operation waits as a status error. A method a
//! route does not take is 405 with an `Allow` header.
//!
//! A PATCH merges the `config` of every kind but a project. A project's config is written as Incus 7.3 writes it
//! (`projectPatch` and `projectPut` in `cmd/incusd/api_project.go`): a PATCH that names `config` replaces the whole config with
//! the keys it sent, and a PUT replaces the config and the description, under `If-Match` like a PATCH. A project and an
//! instance are the objects that take a PUT: an instance's PUT replaces its writable fields whole, under `If-Match`, as an
//! operation. A project that holds an object is in use, and a PATCH or a PUT that would turn off one of its
//! features is refused with 400 and changes nothing, as Incus refuses it.
//!
//! Instances for adoption: an instance that names its `profiles` has its `expanded_devices` and `expanded_config` worked out
//! from those profiles and its own keys, as Incus expands them. A project reads its own profiles when its config sets
//! `features.profiles` to `"true"`, and the default project's otherwise; its `default` profile is empty until a test adds one
//! ([`FakeIncus::add_profile`]). `/1.0/instances/<i>/state` serves the status and each NIC's MAC and IPv4, and a PUT there starts,
//! stops or restarts the instance as an operation. An instance create with `start: true` starts it too. Any start, a restart's
//! included, is refused when the container's init would get other arguments than its `oci.entrypoint` names, by the chain
//! Incus 7.6 runs and the split of the node's liblxc ([`lxc_execute_argv`], [`FakeIncus::set_lxc_split`]), and when an
//! `environment.*` value holds a line break or a carriage return, as Incus 7.6 refuses either at start. A graceful stop can be made to
//! outlast its timeout ([`FakeIncus::hang_stop`]), and then only `force: true` stops it. A NIC's MAC is its device's `hwaddr`,
//! else its `volatile.<dev>.hwaddr`, else one the start
//! generates and keeps there. Its IPv4 is its device's `ipv4.address`, else the lease its MAC holds in the DHCP lease table,
//! else a fresh one the start leases ([`FakeIncus::set_lease`]; `/1.0/networks/<n>/leases`). A lease a start pins, or one
//! [`FakeIncus::set_static_lease`] gives, is listed as static, as Incus lists the lease a NIC's `ipv4.address` names; any other
//! as dynamic. Snapshots and backups are
//! served under `/1.0/instances/<i>/snapshots` and `/1.0/instances/<i>/backups`. A POST to an instance moves it to the project
//! its body names: it must be stopped, the target project must exist, and, as on Incus 7.5, the move is a copy that gets a new
//! `volatile.uuid`. When a PATCH or a move takes a device out of the expanded devices, or changes it in more than its addresses, the fake clears that device's `volatile.<dev>.*` keys as Incus's `deviceVolatileReset`
//! does: every one when the device goes or changes type, and otherwise each one whose key the new device sets. A restricted
//! project refuses a snapshot unless `restricted.snapshots` is `allow`, and a backup unless `restricted.backups` is `allow`.
//! A moved-in instance is refused when a NIC names an ACL that the project serving its network lacks, and, in a restricted
//! project, by the restrictions as Incus 7.5's `checkRestrictions` applies them: the NIC grant, host-path disks and their
//! paths, the device types that need `allow`, privilege, nesting, interception and low-level keys.
//!
//! The fake records each request, and each write with the names of the config keys it carried. It never records a value.
