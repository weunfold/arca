//! Tenants: one restricted project per tenant, on the node's managed service bridge. A tenant is the entry `tenant-<id>`
//! (plugin `arca.tenant`). It owns its project and that project's service profile, and nothing else: it makes no bridge and
//! no network, and its instances sit on the bridge the node's services already use. Each tenant holds a /28 of the service
//! /24, and its instances take their addresses from it (Rules 61 to 65 of the ownership document).
