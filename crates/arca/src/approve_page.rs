//! The owner approval page: an open view of the waiting plans, one passkey approval POST, one registration POST, and the
//! setup-code path that trusts the first passkey from the page and the machine's own screen.
//!
//! The page routes are mounted only when `approvalOrigin` is configured. They sit outside the MCP bearer check and outside
//! the MCP `Origin` refusal: GETs admit no `Origin` or the exact configured one, and POSTs admit only the exact configured
//! one, before any body is read. The canvas chat POST is the one exception: with no `Origin`, it accepts a browser's
//! `Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin`. `/mcp` and every other MCP route keep refusing every `Origin`; `crates/arca-mcp/src/http.rs`
//! is unchanged, and this router is merged into its result in `cmd_serve`.
//!
//! `approvalOrigin` is the page origin and the WebAuthn rp id. It is not the host an approval statement names: the statement
//! host stays `approval_host(&cfg)`. The origin is `https://` and a host name, or `http://localhost:<port>`, the page of a
//! node on its own machine's loopback listener, whose rp id is `localhost`.
//!
//! The setup code reaches the owner on the machine's own screen, or on a terminal of the node's own user: the unix
//! socket, and no other listener, carries `POST /local/setup-code` (see [`Page::local_router`]), which `arca setup-code`
//! calls. It answers only a caller who has just made a file in the node's state directory, which nobody but the node's
//! user can, and a peer on a forwarded socket cannot.
//!
//! With an owner approval request store (`Page::with_approval_requests`), the page lists the requests agents made with
//! `owner_approval_request` in their own section, as data, and approves one with one tap: `POST /approve/requests/begin`
//! mints the statement, the passkey signs it, and `POST /approve/requests/approve` takes the request id, that statement and
//! the proof (see `crate::approval_requests`). `POST /approve/requests/deny` declines one without a passkey.
//!
//! With `approval.linkedHosts`, the page also lists the waiting action proposals of other kernels on this machine and relays
//! the owner's signed approval or decline for one of them to that kernel over its own socket (see `crate::linked`). The page
//! never checks or spends another kernel's approval, and never asks its own kernel about another kernel's id.
