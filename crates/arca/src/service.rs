//! Services: one template-derived container in the service project, with its own NIC ACL. A virtual-machine service is
//! in the same project. On the managed service network it has an address of the same plan and its own NIC ACL, like a
//! container. On a host bridge that already exists it has no ACL, no fixed address and no Incus-managed network.
//!
//! The desired-state entry is the record. Its config names the template, address, ports, links and publication; the
//! live state comes from Incus on every read. Secret values stay in files and enter the Incus config only as references.
