//! The `arca` binary: one node's one-shot watch and metrics reads, scoped token minting, the recording shim, and the Arca MCP
//! server. Every command that needs the node reads one config file, and every command finds it the same way: the one
//! `--config` names, else the one the `ARCA_CONFIG` variable names, else the file the installer writes. A command that
//! writes to a node or acts on one, and did not get its config from the flag, says on stderr which file it uses before it
//! does anything; one that removes or cuts something off names the node's state directory too.
//!
//! Exit codes: 0 for success; 1 for a runtime failure (a socket, a read or a write that failed); 2 for a usage or config
//! failure (a bad command line, a refused config, or a token directory that is unsafe or missing); 3 for a tool error: a refusal,
//! whose JSON-RPC error object `call` prints on stdout, or a tool result with `isError` (arguments the tool does not
//! take, or its own failure), printed as `{"code": ..., "message": ...}`; 4 for a token the node refuses, HTTP 401 or 403. `arca adopt` exits 2 too when
//! it refuses before any write: a preflight check, a stale plan digest, an instance the config does not list, or a record that
//! does not hold the adoption it is asked to resume, release or verify.

defaults, the files the installer writes:
  --config      ~/.config/arca/node.json
  --token-file  ~/.config/arca/assistant-1.secret
  The order is: the flag, then the variable (ARCA_CONFIG, ARCA_TOKEN_FILE), then the default.
  status alone takes one step more: with no token file named and none at the default, it uses a viewer token of this
  node from the default's directory (the viewer.secret of a node installed before that default existed).
  Every command finds its config this way. One that writes to a node or acts on it, without --config, first says on
  stderr which config it uses; one that removes or cuts something off also names the node's state directory.
  A call with --peer sends its token to another node, so its --token-file is always named: it has no default.
  token mint, token revoke, token reload, call --peer, link pair, link join, link remove, probe consumer remove,
  adopt apply, adopt release and init hand out, remove or rewrite something on one node, so the variable alone never
  picks it: when ARCA_CONFIG names another file than the default, they refuse and say the --config to run them with.";
