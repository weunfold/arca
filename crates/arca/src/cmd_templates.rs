//!
//! A file that is missing is written. A file that is already the shipped one is left. A file that is, byte for byte, a
//! version an earlier release shipped ([`EARLIER`]) is brought up to this release's and named under `replaced`: nobody
//! edited it, so nothing of the owner's is lost, and a node keeps no template an upgrade has since fixed. Any other file
//! that differs is kept, since it is the owner's edit, unless `--replace` is given. A template the owner added under
//! another name is never touched.
//!
//! A template and the script it reads move together. Where the owner edited one of them, the other is kept as it is too,
//! though it is an earlier shipped version: a new template is never paired with a script it was not shipped with.
