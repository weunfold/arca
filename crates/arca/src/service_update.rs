//! `service_update`: a running service made from an image by digest, or from a local image pinned by fingerprint,
//! moves to another image in one call.
//!
//! The steps, each journalled in [`SERVICE_UPDATES_FILE`] (an append-only file of JSON lines in the state directory,
//! one `begin` line before anything is sent to Incus, one line per step and one `end` line; no line holds a secret):
//!
//! 1. the instance is stopped, when it runs, and a snapshot of it is taken where the project allows one (an Arca
//!    project never does, so on a node as Arca makes it there is none);
//! 2. its root is rebuilt from the new digest, or, for a local image, from the project's own copy of the new
//!    fingerprint. Incus keeps the config, the devices (the data volume among them), the uuid, the secrets and the
//!    firewall rules; only the root is the new image's;
//! 3. it is started;
//! 4. the health check, within a timeout: a service with a host port (`lan`) is tried through that port's proxy, a
//!    service whose first port is its droidd port is tried at its address, and any other must stay running for a few
//!    seconds, since the node may reach nothing else of it;
//! 5. the new digest is recorded in the service's desired state, so a restart keeps it.
//!
//! A service whose template declares a data volume that its instance has not keeps its data on the root, which the
//! rebuild replaces: it is refused before anything is written, unless the call states `eraseData`, which only an
//! approved proposal may (see [`ServiceHandler::call_update`]).
//!
//! A failure at any step puts the old version back: the snapshot is restored (or, in a project that does not allow
//! snapshots, the root is rebuilt from the old digest), the old version is started when it was running, and the answer
//! is the error and the words "rolled back". Nothing is asked of the owner: the verb is a doctor's, and works in a
//! tenant as it does outside one. The snapshot holds the root, the config and the devices of the instance; the data
//! volume is the service's own and is not snapshotted, so what the new version wrote there stays.
