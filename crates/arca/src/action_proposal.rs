//! Inert action proposals: a viewer may ask the owner to approve one of a closed set of service, database, GPU, storage,
//! snapshot and instance start, stop and restart actions.
//!
//! A proposal changes nothing. It carries the action's own arguments, a digest over the canonical `{action, args}`, the
//! exact arguments the owner is shown as `details`, and a plain-language summary built here from the validated arguments.
//! The kernel keeps at most [`MAX_WAITING`] unexpired proposals; a ninth is refused with `TooManyProposals` rather than
//! silently retiring an older one. A repeated digest returns the record that already waits.
//!
//! The proposals live in an append-only journal next to the effect journal, `action-proposals.jsonl`. Every record is one
//! line with an `event` of `proposed`, `approved`, `declined` or `result`. Opening the kernel replays the file, re-checks
//! every proposed record against its action's own validation and the kernel's configured image, keeps only the waiting,
//! unexpired proposals and rewrites it atomically. A file that cannot be read, holds a line that fails validation, or is too
//! large is quarantined as `<name>.bad-<ts>` and the kernel starts with no proposals: this file can never stop a start. The
//! file holds no approval string, proof or secret.
//!
//! Appending keeps the journal bounded as well: once the file passes [`MAX_COMPACT_BYTES`] it is compacted to the waiting set
//! before the call returns. A stale temporary file from a compaction that a crash interrupted is removed when the kernel next
//! opens the directory, so a reused process id cannot stand in the way.
