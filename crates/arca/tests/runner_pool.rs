//! The runner pool's controller (`templates/github-runner-pool.sh run`) against a fake GitHub API and a fake `docker`.
//!
//! The controller is the shipped script, unchanged: only what it reaches outside itself is replaced. GitHub is a small
//! HTTP server in this file that checks every credential it is given. `docker` and `systemctl` are scripts on the
//! controller's `PATH` (`tests/runner_pool/fake-docker.sh` plays a runner: it takes one job with the just-in-time
//! configuration it was started with, and exits). `curl` is the real one behind a wrapper that records its arguments.
//! Paths, pauses and the machine's memory come from the environment.
//!
//! The controller's `PATH` holds those stand-ins and the programs the script declares in `POOL_PROGRAMS`, and nothing
//! else. A program the script starts without declaring it is therefore not found, bash reports it to a function this
//! test hands it, and `Pool::stop` fails on the report. The first boot checks that same list after it has installed
//! its packages, so a program the controller needs cannot go unchecked. What no test here can prove is that the
//! packages of `POOL_PACKAGES` bring those programs on a real Debian: the first boot's own check says so on the machine.
//!
//! So this proves the controller's own logic: registration, one job per runner, replacement, admission by memory, the
//! cap, cleanup, and that no credential reaches any output or any command line. It does not prove Docker, a real
//! runner, cgroup accounting or GitHub itself; `docs/OPERATING.md` lists what stays unproven.
//!
//! The test needs `bash`, `curl`, `jq`, `openssl` and `flock` on the machine that runs it. Every credential is made here.
